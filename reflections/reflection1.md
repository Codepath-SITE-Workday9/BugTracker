## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We managed to finish just about everything on our sprint board. We completed most of the backend with the exception of 3-4 endpoints. All security and authentication features have been implemented. The frontend successfully implemented 2 libraries, chart.js and material-table. The frontend’s login/register functionality works. The dashboard is pretty much finished with some minor tweaks needed. The projects page and teams page are almost done. The tickets page is about 50% done

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Importing libraries, iterating through multiple many to many relationships between database tables to authenticate the user within the queries, learning how to manage arrays within the queries and optimize certain functions for repeated use through all routes/endpoints

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We finished almost every single task in our sprint plan, with the exception of the tickets endpoint in the backend which was 1 task. Currently, that one is being  worked on and will likely be completed very soon. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Previous labs helped prepare in executing our capstone project sprint this week. Working on login/registration functionality in previous  labs such as the Lifetracker lab helped a lot, and it was helpful to be able to reference the logic used in these labs.  Another resource that was increasingly helpful in being able to complete the authentication and json web token permissions in the backend were the student store and Lifetracker projects that used both concepts and were used as reference to complete the scripts for those files in the capstone project.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 In terms of our MVP, we are on track to complete all proposed features and user stories with the exception of user story 3 which is associated with a stretch feature and not part of our core features in the MVP. If any user stories or features become at risk with the next week, we will reprioritize the features in our MVP.
