## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We completed all of our background endpoints/routes including extra routes for some of our stretch features.
We created some of the pages for our stretch features for next week’s sprint.
We finished connecting our Teams, Tickets, and Projects pages to routes on the backend.
We implemented some testing suites to assure that our backend was functioning as was expected.
We connected our statistics’ graphs to the backend information.


* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Some challenges this week included getting the Material Tables implemented into the ProjectsPage and TeamsPage. We needed to create additional routes to get an array of users in order to be able to use the material tables.  Additionally, there were some problems with the responsiveness of our bug tracker that made it difficult to view information on smaller screen but are currently fixing this issue going into our next sprint. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 All of our tasks in the sprint plan for this week have been completed. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The resources provided helped us prepare in executing our capstone project immensely. A resource I find myself looking back at constantly are the Lifetracker project as well as the Student Store project. These two projects utilized a lot of the concepts and basic styling layouts we were seeking to implement into our bugtracker, and having them as a reference has simplified our struggle immensely.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Currently, in terms of our MVP, we were able to complete all of our core features and even got the chance to build out the skeletons for some stretch features to complete for the next sprint. In general, no features or user stories are considered to be at risk. However, we are reprioritizing some of the more ambitious stretch features given the time restraint of our next sprint.
