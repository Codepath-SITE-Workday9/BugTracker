## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We managed to fix some bugs with our charts and have them properly receive and update data as they come into our database from the backend. We were able to add filters to some of our pages that allow you to select what you want with greater precision. We also worked on deploying and got that up and running with a few fixes that need to be added. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We faced some major challenges involving some bugs that we were trying to fix. Some challenges included getting some of our endpoints to work properly, as well as getting some of our components to re-render when updating information in our database. We also had major challenges with building successfully and being able to deploy. In the end, we were able to resolve most of the issues.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We managed to finish all of the planned tasks on our sprint board for this week. At the beginning of the week, however, we had to reassess our original stretch goals and decide one which stretch features we would implement this week. We decided to prioritize fixing bugs and deploying which resulted in less time for stretch features. For this reason, we decided at the beginning of the week to only add one stretch feature to our sprint board for this week due to time constraints. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, the resources provided to us throughout our planning and all prior labs have been an immense help in debugging and creating the core features of our MVP. While debugging through the frontend and creating the necessary components, we often found ourselves looking back at the implementation of similar features in the LifeTracker and Student Store project. These resources not only helped us debug some of more difficult components but also find a way to optimize the scripts to increase performance time.


* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

After we finished created our MVP, we decided to re-assess our priorities in terms of adding new features and the risk of implementing and debugging them in time. It became clear that the core features of our MVP was enough to make our bugtracker usable for all types of users and decided to prioritize creating a responsive and user accessible interface. In doing so, we opted out of creating a team velocity / statistics page in our bugtracker due to the time restrictions and decided to implement the smaller features of the statistics throughout our site. While the statistics page was at risk, we reprioritized the features of our bugtracker to include smaller ticket statistics on the dashboard and on the user profile rather than create an entirely dedicated page.
